# The_Deadweights
Bootcamp Group Project 1

Our motivating questions:
1) Is there data to validate the claim that "data science" is a growing career field? 
2) Have these job postings grown over time? 
3) Are there keywords that showed trends in job postings data?

Using teamwork, Google-Fu, a Jupyter Notebook (including Python, Pandas, & Matplotlib), with a concluding slide presentation of our findings, we have attempted to seek out what is sought out in the growing field of data science jobs.

Please reference the following files in order to see our findings:
- itproject.csv shows a public dataset of over 10,000 rows of job postings collected (source URL = https://www.kaggle.com/sl6149/data-scientist-job-market-in-the-us)
- indeed_job_dataset.csv shows a dataset of findings collected and cleaned to only show postings from the Indeed job board over a period of months (source URL = https://www.kaggle.com/elroyggj/datasets)
- A final Jupyter notebook, file Final_Jupyter_Project_NB.ipynb, with our process in reading these CSV files, cleaning the dataframes, and creating visualizations to show key findings.
- Uploaded images of these visualizations, all as .png files
- A presentation PDF with our a "top-level" view of the analysis
- A Project_Findings PDF with a summary of our initial, motivating questions. This synopsis includes the answers to these questions along with notes for future research that could be conducted on the subject and future notes as we pursue our own careers in this field.
