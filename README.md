# The_Deadweights
Bootcamp Group Project 1

Our motivating questions:
1) Is there data to validate the claim that "data science" is a growing career field? 
2) Have these job postings grown over time? 
3) Are there keywords that showed trends in job postings data?

Using teamwork, Google-Fu, Jupyter Notebook and a concluding slide presentation of our findings, we have attempted to seek out what is sought out in the growing field of data science jobs.
